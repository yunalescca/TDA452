Test Data Generators
====================

-- QuickCheck can perform random testing with values of any type which is in class *** Arbitrary ***

For any type a in Arbitrary there is a random value generator, Gen a. Gen a is a QuickCheck random generator.

Gen is a Monad so things of type Gen a are another kind of "instruction" (as IO)

-- The Arbitrary class contains an instance/a variable called arbitrary, which is of type Gen a

arbitrary :: Gen a
